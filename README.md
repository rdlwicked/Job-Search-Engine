# Job-Search-Engine
This is the skeleton code for Edunin's "Most Popular Jobs Only!" task 

These are example code snippets for each file in the skeleton code structure. You will need to further expand and customize the code according to your specific project requirements, including adding views, database relationships, form handling, and more.

Remember to install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt, and update the config.py file with your desired database details and secret key.

Please note that the code provided here is just an example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific project requirements and coding style.
